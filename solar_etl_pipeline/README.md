# Solar ETL Pipeline Project

## Description
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing solar sensor data. The pipeline follows a microservices architecture with services for data ingestion, curation, transformation, and visualization. The system is designed to be scalable and can be deployed on cloud platforms like Azure or run locally.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Apache Airflow 2.2.2
- All other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or cloud environment.
2. Install the required Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure Apache Airflow and initialize the database using `airflow db init`.
4. Create an Airflow user with `airflow users create --username <username> --password <password> --firstname <firstname> --lastname <lastname> --role Admin --email <email>`.
5. Start the Airflow web server with `airflow webserver -p 8080`.
6. In a new terminal, start the Airflow scheduler with `airflow scheduler`.

### Configuration
- Edit the `config/config.yaml` file to set up the data adaptors with the correct parameters for your data sources.

### Running the Pipeline
- Enable the `solar_etl_pipeline` DAG in the Airflow web interface.
- Trigger the DAG manually or wait for the scheduled run.

## Interpreting Visualizations
The visualizations generated by the pipeline provide insights into solar panel performance and the impact of environmental conditions. They follow the organization's standards for mapping metrics to visualization components, ensuring clarity and consistency in data representation.
